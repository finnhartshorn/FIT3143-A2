Parallel Computing Assignment 2

Simulates a sensor network of 60 nodes and a base station. Each node generates a random value, it then confers with its 4 closest neighbours. If all values are over a certain threshold, the node reports an event to the base station.
At the end of the set number the base station calculates some basic statistics and prints them out.

Mpi was used to implement multithreaded behaviour.
